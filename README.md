# Monthly-Rent-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
A Python project that predicts monthly rent trends using Linear Regression. The system allows users to input yearly rent data, stores it in a CSV file, and applies machine learning to forecast future rents. It also provides performance metrics (MSE, RÂ²) and an optional visualization of data and predictions using Matplotlib.
